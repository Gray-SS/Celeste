# Celeste

*Welcome to the Celeste source code repository!*    

Celeste is an open-source C# game engine currently based on top of the [Monogame](https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame) framework, focusing mainly on the creation of 2D games.

## Work in progress
The project is currently under development.
I think it's also important to point out that this project is first and foremost a hobbyist project. By this, I mean that a lack of experience is to be expected.
That said, if you come across any errors, bugs or unexpected behavior, don't hesitate to create an issue to help the project grow! Any suggestions are also welcome.
